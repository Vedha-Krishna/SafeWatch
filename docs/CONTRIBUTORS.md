## 🧹 Cleaner Agent (Alex)

- [x] Whitespace normalization
- [ ] Strip HTML tags & URLs from raw text
- [ ] Remove usernames / handles (`@mentions`)
- [ ] Normalize date & time phrases (`"ytd"` → ISO timestamp)

- [ ] Detect and flag language (English vs non-English)
- [ ] Truncate or summarize excessively long posts
- [ ] Pass cleaned fields into `IncidentState` (`location_text`, `normalized_time` currently not set by cleaner)

---

## 🤖 Classifier Agent (Patrick)

- [x] LLM authenticity prompt written
- [x] Fix scoring formula (vandalism → 0.72, harassment → 0.71, all known categories now clear the 0.70 threshold)
- [ ] Add `source_reliability` & corroboration scores
- [ ] Set `temperature=0` on LLM calls
- [x] Vector similarity scoring
- [ ] Unreported incident check

---

## ⚖️ Decision Agent (Patrick)

- [x] Write publish / reject / merge to Supabase
- [ ] Merge logic for duplicates
- [ ] Connect decision → map pin

---

## 🔁 Feedback Loops (Patrick)

- [x] `agent_feedback` table in DB
- [x] Feedback API routes
- [x] Classifier → Crawler loop
- [x] Decision → Classifier loop
- [x] Demo one full loop live

---

## 🧠 LangGraph Pipeline (Ameer)

- [x] LangGraph graph built
